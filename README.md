# Brain and Consciousness

![img](./profile/HBFlogo.png)

Prepare yourself for an insightful exploration into the captivating realm of the brain and consciousness. These fascinating subjects have long occupied the minds of scientists and deep thinkers. With a purposeful stride, we embark on a journey that delves into the intricacies of this profound connection, approaching the topic with a level of formality, befitting its significance.

The **HBF** - Brain and Consciousness initiative at the University of Bergen is a research interest group focused on exploring various aspects of the brain and consciousness. This initiative encompasses a wide range of topics, including neuroscientific research, technological advancements in AI, philosophical theories, animal decision-making, ethical considerations, artistic intelligence, and educational challenges related to understanding consciousness in both biological and artificial systems.

The HBF initiative involves multidisciplinary collaboration among experts in fields such as neuroscience, psychology, computer science, philosophy, art, and other relevant disciplines. This type of research is crucial for advancing our understanding of consciousness, which remains one of the most intriguing and complex subjects in both science and philosophy.

The initiative engages in various activities such as organizing seminars, discussions, research projects, and disseminating talks and presentations on GitHub and elsewhere to foster a deeper understanding of the brain and consciousness in the era of AGI. These activities would also encourage critical thinking and open-minded exploration of this challenging domain.

Given its focus, the HBF initiative at the University of Bergen represents a significant effort in the ongoing quest to unravel the mysteries of consciousness and how it manifests in both humans and potentially in artificial entities.

The intricacies of how the brain gives rise to consciousness remain a profound mystery within the vast landscape of scientific inquiry. Esteemed scientists passionately pursue a deeper understanding of this enigmatic relationship, employing rigorous methodologies and diligent inquiry to illuminate this extraordinary phenomenon.

A prevailing theory posits that consciousness emerges from the intricacies of neural connectivity within the brain. According to this line of thought, consciousness is not confined to a singular region but emerges from the orchestrated interplay of neural activity across diverse areas. This emergent property of the brain, built upon the remarkable network of neurons, enables the rich tapestry of conscious experiences.

Another compelling avenue of exploration delves into the intricate interplay between consciousness and the unconscious mind. It has been postulated that the hidden processes occurring within the recesses of the unconscious realm profoundly influence our conscious experiences. These unseen mechanisms, guided by intricate neural patterns, sculpt our reality in ways we are only beginning to comprehend.

As we embark upon this intellectual odyssey, we recognize that the exploration of the brain and consciousness is a scholarly pursuit that demands the utmost rigor and reasoned inquiry. By embracing scientific advancements (including AI) and philosophical discourse, we inch closer to unraveling the profound mysteries within the human mind.

Throughout this scholarly journey, we maintain the utmost respect for the complexity of the subject matter. We acknowledge the enduring fascination that the brain and consciousness hold for academia and seek to contribute to that body of knowledge with a steadfast commitment to intellectual rigor.

In this spirit, let us march forward, equipped with the tools of scientific inquiry, deep contemplation, and the pursuit of knowledge. Each step unveils a greater understanding of the extraordinary relationship between the brain and consciousness, forever shaping our perception of the human experience.

Fundamental research in science is being transformed by a practice predominantly associated with the arts: namely hallucinations. 

This rapid [artist] overview of key scientific AI examples (that covers a year loosely defined as starting with the release of GPT-4 on March 14th, 2023) is framed by the hypothesis that fundamental research in science is being transformed by a practice predominantly associated with the arts: namely hallucinations. Hallucinations in people are conventionally associated with mental illness, drugs, and/or genius. Hallucinations in AI (mostly in large language models) have been critiqued as net-negatives: contributing to disinformation, bias, post-truth, deep-fakes, collapse of democracy, copyright theft, etc… Yet at the same time, AI hallucinations (of proteins/crystals/algorithms/circuits etc) pruned down to the feasible, are contributing to a revolutionary acceleration of scientific discoveries in numeric-algorithmic optimizations, AI hardware accelerators, reward mechanism design, non-invasive brain sensors, drug discovery, sustainable deep-tech materials, autonomous lab robotics, neuromorphic organoid computing, and mathematical reasoning. In both art and science, hallucinations are almost enough: without the pruning down to the plausible, there is just a sprawl of potentiality.
