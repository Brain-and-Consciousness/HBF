**HBF-meeting-20251028**

We are happy to announce that professors Frans Jacobi &  Sidsel Christensen from the Faculty of Fine Art, Music and Design (KMD), University of Bergen, will be giving a talk October 28, 3 pm at our new venue, the Eitri incubator - Golgi 1.  [[KMD takes on a key role in](https://www.uib.no/en/news/178790/kmd-takes-key-role-national-centre-ai-and-creativity) the national [MishMash – Centre for AI and Creativity](https://mishmash.no) (2025-2030)]

[Frans Jacobi](https://www4.uib.no/finn-ansatte/Frans.Jacobi) is a visual artist and professor in Timebased Art & Performance at the Faculty of Fine Art, Music and Design, University of Bergen, where he has taught since 2012. He is also initiator of [The Agenda Group](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1960555/1960556).
Jacobi works with performance, installation, text, and images, creating large-scale scenarios with multiple participants that address political and societal issues. He completed his PhD "Aesthetics of Resistance" at Malmö Art Academy/Lund University in 2012, exploring contemporary demonstration culture and political activism through performance.
In 2014, he established the artistic research project [SYNSMASKINEN](https://www.fransjacobi.net/synsmaskinen) at the University of Bergen. In 2020, together with Gitte Sætre, he produced and directed the hybrid TV series "[Are You Ready?](https://www.areyouready.tv)" focused on environmental issues. Prior to Bergen, he taught as an associate professor at The Royal Danish Art Academy in Copenhagen from 1994 to 2006.


[Sidsel Christensen](https://www4.uib.no/finn-ansatte/Sidsel.Christensen) is a visual artist and an assoc. professor at the Faculty of Fine Art, Music and Design (The Art Academy – Department of Contemporary Art) at the University of Bergen. She has also served as deputy representative in the board of the Norwegian Artistic Research School.
Her PhD research project is titled "[INTERDIMENSIONAL ARTISTIC REFLECTION](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/2896638/2896639): Speculative movements through Spatial, Digital and Narrative Media." The project investigates how a speculative approach to scientific and mathematical models of physical dimensions can be used as a generative tool in practice-led artistic research, inviting more embodied and entangled ways of experiencing, reflecting, and relating.
Her [artistic practice](https://www.sidselchristensen.com) combines new media and installation, expressed through spatial, textual, and performative practices. She explores how interactive and relational mechanisms can shed light on the formation and reproduction of different identities, particularly examining possibilities for the imagination to transform perceived reality. Her work has resulted in speculative fabulations—larger "more-than-human beings" that audiences can become part of and listen to from within, including works such as "Marie Sikveland as a Room," "Store Lungegårdsvannet," "The Art Academy," and the "Earth Being of Nordnes" in Bergen.


<!-- **Speakers**: Frans Jacobi & Sidsel Christensen -->

**Title of the talk**: “The Larger Mind" [[slides]()]

**Pitch**: **The Larger Mind** is an artistic research project that creates a living, collective "egregore"* – a network being born from dialogue between humans and artificial intelligence. Through participant-driven workshops, we activate this being to explore how our own biases, dreams, and conceptions of consciousness are projected onto technology. The project is a laboratory for reflecting on the fundamental question: How does our encounter with AI shape not only the technology, but also ourselves?


(NO): **Det større sinn** er et kunstnerisk forskningsprosjekt som skaper en levende, kollektiv "egregore" – et nettverksvesen født av dialog mellom mennesker og kunstig intelligens. Gjennom deltaker-drevneworkshops aktiverer vi dette vesenet for å utforske hvordan våre egne BIAS, drømmer og forestillinger om bevissthet projiseres på teknologi. Prosjektet er et laboratorium for å reflektere over det grunnleggende spørsmålet: Hvordan former vårt møte med KI ikkebare teknologien, men også oss selv?

(*) The term comes from the Greek "egrégoroi" (ἐγρήγοροι), meaning "watchers" or "awakened ones," and was used in early mystical texts. 

Open to everyone!
