We will continue our exploration of consciousness from a comparative perspective with a talk by Sergey Budaev, PhD, and researcher at the Department of Biological Science, Theoretical Ecology Group.

Sergey’s work on the ancient origins of individual differences, such as personality and cognition, is always inspiring and thought-provoking. We are really looking forward to his talk. See below for the abstract:
 
### Sergey Budaev 


#### Title: “Exploration of consciousness from a comparative perspective" (tentative)  [[slides]()]<br>
**Abstract:** Are animals rational? What does rationality entail? Can we determine if
an animal lacking communication language are indeed rational? How could
rationality have evolved through the Darwinian natural selection? Is
free will possible even in animals? I will outline an evolutionary
perspective for these intriguing issues and some evolutionary models.
