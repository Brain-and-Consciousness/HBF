## HBF-meeting-20250506

We are happy to announce that Associate Professor [Paul Hamilton](https://www4.uib.no/en/find-employees/Paul.Hamilton) from IBMP will be giving a talk May 6. 15.00 at our usual spot Borgaskaret at Alrek. Hamilton has done a lot of [pioneering work](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7982-4659) on the neuroscience behind psychiatric disorders and will be delving further into the brain body connection in his talk.

#### Title: “Examining brain-body relations in the metabolic domain using holistic versus analytic approaches " [[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSAotFgXgkL6jmw5b-BeI2SFfv-5HUKgPuqmikw2P6S54bqyn1n4Z0GSuPbDiFlU8wkWabV_-1tIACd/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)]<br>
**Abstract:** We know that things like metabolic disturbance can impact how we feel and, therefore, that there must be some kind of body-brain relation involved. The nature of this relation is unclear, however, even at the grossest level. In this study, we examine relations between different indicators of metabolic dysfunction—body-mass index and blood apolipoprotein B:A1 levels (bad-to-good cholesterol ratio)—and regional grey matter volume. We employ a “highlight-don’t-hide” analysis approach that assumes: 1) that predictor variables do not perfectly correspond to the constructs that they attempt to operationalise; and 2) that it is better to be fully transparent about relations among predictor variables as opposed to simply “factoring out” these relations with the general linear model. In our results, we see both intriguing new directions for brain-metabolomic science and pitfalls that can be avoided by employing a more holistic consideration of the data.
