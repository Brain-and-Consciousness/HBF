#### Title: â€œWhite noise hallucinations and the protective effects of estrogen for psychotic symptoms" [[slides]()]<br>
**Abstract:** The estrogen hypothesis for schizophrenia suggests neuroprotective effects of estrogen. Estrogen has been proposed to delay the development of the disorder and reduce symptom severity, including auditory hallucinations. Furthermore, estrogen has previously shown enhancing effects on cognitive control, a function that is also implicated in auditory hallucinations. Whether estrogen affects the tendency to hallucinate in healthy participants, and the potential mediating role of cognitive control, was addressed in the current study.  In order to induce hallucinatory experiences in the participants, a white noise paradigm was used. The paradigm simulates a hallucinatory state by induction of negative emotions and drainage of cognitive resources. The drainage of cognitive resources was done with a N-back working memory task in which cognitive load could be manipulated. The simultaneous exposure to white noise elicit experiences of hearing voices (false alarms). Participants were tested during the menstrual cycle in either the early follicular phase (low estradiol) or late follicular phase (high estradiol). The results suggest an estradiol-related change in hallucination proneness across the menstrual cycle, but the idea that cognitive functioning mediates this relationship was not supported. Overall, the study supports protective effects of estradiol on hallucination proneness, and that such effects are not specific to schizophrenia.
