Dear everyone, 

we are happy to announce our talk next Tuesday 25.2 15.00 @ Alrek Borgaskaret with Professor Jarl Giske (see below). 

Jarle’s Talks are always interesting and though provoking, and from the description this will be no exception! <br>

#### Title: “Agency: On genes and organisms in evolution” <br>
**Abstract:** Richard Dawkins’ famous replicator and vehicle metaphor describes genes as the evolutionary drivers and organisms as the means of preserving and copying them. Lately, this perspective, and in general the gene-centered view of evolution in the Modern Synthesis, has been challenged by an organism-centered view on evolution. Animal agency has been discussed since Aristotle and gained new momentum with Kantian philosophy. While organisms have a wider role than passive effectors of genetic codes, we agree with the Modern Synthesis that their agentic powers and perceived/apparent purposefulness ultimately come from mutation and selection. As natural selection cannot see genes but organisms, both genes and organisms are evolutionary players, and we think that the evolutionary and ecological role of the organism is better explained by the metaphor of an “agent” rather than a “vehicle”. As agency in organisms is inherited through genes, the organisms are “as if” agents on their behalf. We discuss some major steps in the evolution of agency and purposiveness from the first life forms to vertebrates. The beginning of free will can be traced to learning and animals with conflicting emotions and thereafter those with plans for their near future. Another change in agency happened in the human lineage when language could facilitate more efficient cultural evolution, so that even norms and values can change due to social learning during the life of a human being. This has given us a higher level of free will, but still in the “as if” category.
