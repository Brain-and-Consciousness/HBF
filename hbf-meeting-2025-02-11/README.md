Dear everyone,

 
We will follow up on Bjørn’s excellent talk with his PhD student Floris Hendrikus Johannes van den Oever presenting on his forthcoming thesis defense.


The talk will be in Munin, where we were last time (Underetasjen Alrek). It will be from 15.-16.00 on 11.2.

 

All are very welcome!

#### Title: “ Augmented Reality for maritime collaboration” <br>
**Abstract:** High-quality collaboration is crucial for safe and efficient maritime operations. Collaboration is a factor in maritime operations, such as ship navigation, port construction, and maintenance and inspection of offshore units. A challenge for collaboration is that crewmembers have different perspectives and information, which may be derived from direct observation, instruments, or their memory and mental models. Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to improve maritime collaboration through facilitating team decision-making, team situation awareness (TSA), and communication. This PhD project investigated the potential of AR in facilitating collaboration within maritime operations. It comprised three core studies: a systematic literature review, a laboratory study using virtual reality (VR), and a field study employing AR. The literature review examined current AR applications across various maritime operations, including ship navigation, construction, and maintenance. The laboratory and field studies focused on the use of AR for collaborative ship navigation, emphasizing three key constructs of collaboration: team decision-making, TSA, and communication, along with user experience, and the advantages and disadvantages of AR. Findings indicate that AR can aid communication by simplifying information gathering, displaying the same information to all crewmembers, and providing visual tools like highlighting and crosshairs. It can improve TSA by increasing head-up time, making information more accessible, and supporting mental mapping. Team decision-making is improved through enhanced communication and TSA. Other advantages of AR can include increased operator mobility, the first-person perspective, and resource-efficiency. Disadvantages include overreliance, cognitive overload, attention capture, and visual clutter. In conclusion, intelligently developed AR has the potential to improve the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of the maritime industry through improving collaboration by facilitating team decision-making, TSA, and communication.
