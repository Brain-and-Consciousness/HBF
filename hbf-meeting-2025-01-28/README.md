Hello HBF Members,

Godt Nyttår <img src="./assets/nyttaar.png" width="35" style="vertical-align: middle;">

Here we are, at the start of a new year and a new HBF season, which starts with a BANG: we have the pleasure of hosting:
 
### Bjørn Sætrevik 

with a surprising talk that will give everyone food for thought and fresh results on a popular topic: cognitive dissonance. We hope to see each other again on Tuesday the 28th @ 15.00 in Borgaskaret (Alrek Helseklynge). Everyone most welcome!

#### Title: “A multilab registered report replication of the cognitive dissonance effect” [[Paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/25152459231213375)]*  [[Slides pptx]([text](https://github.com/Brain-and-Consciousness/HBF/blob/main/hbf-meeting-2025-01-28/assets/Registered_report_replication_of_cognitive_dissonance.pptx))] [[pdf]([text](https://github.com/Brain-and-Consciousness/HBF/blob/main/hbf-meeting-2025-01-28/assets/Registered_report_replication_of_cognitive_dissonance.pdf))] [[code](./code)]
**Abstract:** The concept of “cognitive dissonance” may be the closest we’ve come to a grand unified theory of how minds operate. Despite its central position, the empirical basis for the phenomenon is surprisingly weak. In this talk, I’ll describe how a multi-lab collaboration I’ve been involved it that has attempted to place the theory on a surer footing. We designed a “constructive replication” intended to demonstrate the effect, to create a seminal experimental paradigm for the effect, and to explore the psychological mechanisms behind it. This ambitious project ended up being even more challenging than expected, as it grew to have over 100 authors from 39 countries, around 5,000 participants, was delayed by a pandemic, and had surprising results. I’ll try to disentangle some of the study design choices, experiences from the research process, and the implications of the findings. The project was designed as a “registered report replication” in order to ensure transparency and rigor, to encourage adversarial input and to counteract publication bias. As this research model may be unfamiliar to some in the audience, I’ll also try to explain and advocate for this approach.
